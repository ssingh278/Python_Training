Day 2
What I learnt today:

# Today, I learnt about the literals variable and datatypes
# Literal : it is a memory place holder for Known Values
# Datatype: it is a memory allocation tool through which we can allocate memory.with he help of datatype we can identify 3 aspects of allocated memory: format, size, List item
# By default in python we have only one datatype support i.e Object
# Then, learnt about casting vs conversion
# casting - a data type converted into another data type by programmer (other terms used: Narrow conversion, Explicit conversion)
# conversion - a data type converted into another data type by compiler, interpreter and compiling time.(other term used: Wide conversion, Implicit conversion, coercion)
# python does not have its own compiler it has interpreter
# General knowledge boosting : What is programming? A programmer needs to talk with OS to do so, they use datatype and send it to OS. Then, OS translate it to a memory address which is either store in heap or stack.
# heap: It do dynamical memory allocation
# stack: It do unique memory allocation
# There are two type of OOPS:
	-> Full OOPS - Use both heap and stack (example - C#, C++)
	-> Pure OOPS - Use only heap  (example - python)
# Then, I learnt about different type of string display method using input:
	-> placeholder using datatype format characters, Example
		* print("Student Name=%s"%name)
		* print("Student Rollno=%d"%rollno)
		* print("Student Gender=%c"%gender)
		* print("Student Fee=%f"%fee)
	-> using format function, Example:
		* print("Student Name={0} \n Student Rollno={1} \n Student Gender={2} \n Student Fee={3}".format(name,rollno,gender,fee))
	-> using f-string, Example
		* print(f"Student Name={name} \n Student Rollno={rollno} \n Student Gender={gender} \n Student Fee={fee}")
